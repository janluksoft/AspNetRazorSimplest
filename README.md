# ASP.NET Core Razor Pages simplest

This is the simplest Razor-Pages project that can be. 

It has two html (cshtml) pages without using other Razor mechanisms. There are a lot of examples of Razor-Pages on the internet using the sample page creator. There are a lot of unnecessary files on such a page and a beginner does not know which files are the most important. 
Therefore, this project is created by manually adding only the necessary folders and files.
